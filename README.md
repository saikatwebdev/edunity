EDUNITY is a EdTech Platform where I used HTML, CSS, JS along with I made a system where student can put their academic scores and according to their performance they will get some prediction of their career. I used Data Analysis for making this system


It was fun for me making this project. If you know better to make it more attachable you can give pull requests.
